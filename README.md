Flip - Puzzle Platformer

  Flip is a handheld-controller based game where the main interaction is flipping the controller to change the layout of the stage. Itâ€™s a simple platformer that forces the player to remember the placement of each platform between the two layouts in order to successfully traverse the stage. The flipping mechanic encourages the player to strategically navigate each level to overcome obstacles that would typically seem like dead ends. Other mechanics are only the essentials of any platformer, a left and right movement switch and a jump button.
